It operates on the same basic principle, but incldes two additional weapons: the lizard and the legendary Star Trek villian Spock. This version of the game gained popularity after it was used to settle a dispute about what to watch on TV between characers Sheldon and Raj in the popular TV sitcom The Big Bang Theory.
